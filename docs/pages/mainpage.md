## Introduction

sACN is a C-language library (with C++ wrappers) that implements **ANSI E1.31: Lightweight streaming protocol for
transport of DMX512 using ACN**, commonly referred to as **Streaming ACN** or **sACN**. The sACN
library is designed to be portable and scalable to almost any sACN usage scenario, from lightweight
embedded devices to large-scale data sending operations.

Check out \ref getting_started to get started with using the library in your application. To jump
right into the documentation, check out the [Modules Overview](\ref sACN).

## Standard Revision

The sACN library currently implements ANSI E1.31-2018. E1.31-2016 adds synchronization and universe
discovery features to sACN. E1.31-2018 adds IPv6 support.

## Platforms

sACN uses ETC's Platform Abstraction Layer (EtcPal) for platform abstraction, and it runs on every
platform supported by EtcPal; that list can be found [here](https://etclabs.github.io/EtcPal/docs/head/).

## Dependencies

### EtcPal

sACN depends on ETC's Platform Abstraction Library (EtcPal) for platform abstraction. EtcPal is
included as a git submodule in the sACN repository. The sACN CMake configuration will also
automatically detect the presence of an EtcPal directory at the same level as the sACN root
directory, and use that as its dependency.
