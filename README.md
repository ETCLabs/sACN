# sACN

*Streaming ACN (sACN)* is an ANSI standard for entertainment technology by
[ESTA](http://tsp.esta.org) for transmission of DMX512 data over IP networks. sACN is widely used
in the entertainment industry for real-time control of entertainment technology, especially
lighting fixtures.

This repository contains a C-language library and a C++ wrapper library for communicating via sACN.

**NOTE**: This open-source implementation is still in development. The merge receiver, source, and
source detector have not been implemented yet.

## Building

For instructions on building the sACN library, as well as an sACN overview and in-depth
documentation, please see the [documentation](http://etclabs.github.io/sACN).

## Standard Version

This repository will implement ANSI E1.31-2018. It is currently in development. You can download the standard
document for free from the [ESTA TSP downloads page](https://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/published_docs.php).
