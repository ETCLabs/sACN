/**
 * @defgroup sacn_dmx_merger sACN DMX Merger
 * @ingroup sACN
 * @brief The sACN DMX Merger API; see @ref using_dmx_merger.
 *
 * This API provides a software merger for buffers containing DMX512-A start code 0 packets.
 * It also uses buffers containing DMX512-A start code 0xdd packets to support per-address priority.
 *
 * When asked to calculate the merge, the merger will evaluate the current source
 * buffers and update two result buffers:
 *  - 512 bytes for the merged data levels (i.e. "winning level").  These are calculated by using
 *     a Highest-Level-Takes-Precedence(HTP) algorithm for all sources that share the highest
 *     per-address priority.
 *  - 512 source identifiers (i.e. "winning source") to indicate which source was considered the
 *     source of the merged data level, or that no source currently owns this address.
 *
 * This API is thread-safe.
 *
 * See @ref using_dmx_merger for a detailed description of how to use this API.
