/**
 * @brief Notify that a new data packet has been received and merged.
 *
 * This callback will be called in multiple ways:
 * 1. When a new non-preview data packet or per-address priority packet is received from the sACN Receiver module,
 * it is immediately and synchronously passed to the DMX Merger. If the sampling period has not ended, the merged result
 * is not passed to this callback until the sampling period ends. Otherwise, it is immediately and synchronously passed
 * to this callback.
 * 2. When a sACN source is no longer sending non-preview data or per-address priority packets, the lost source callback
 * from the sACN Receiver module will be passed to the merger, after which the merged result is passed to this callback
 * pending the sampling period.
 *
 * This callback should be processed quickly, since it will interfere with the receipt and processing of other sACN
 * packets on the universe.
 *
 * @param[in] handle The handle to the merge receiver instance.
 * @param[in] universe The universe this merge receiver is monitoring.
 * @param[in] slots Buffer of #DMX_ADDRESS_COUNT bytes containing the merged levels for the universe. This buffer is
 * owned by the library.
 * @param[in] slot_owners Buffer of #DMX_ADDRESS_COUNT source_ids.  If a value in the buffer is
 *           #SACN_DMX_MERGER_SOURCE_INVALID, the corresponding slot is not currently controlled. You can also use
 *           #SACN_DMX_MERGER_SOURCE_IS_VALID(slot_owners, index) to check the slot validity. This buffer is owned by
